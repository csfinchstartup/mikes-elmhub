## Intro

This is *not* a test; it is not pass/fail. It's intended to show general problem
solving skills and your approach to building out a UI.

We believe this is a much better approach to hiring frontend engineers when
compared to standard CS questions.

## Problem definition

We're looking to build the screenshot below.  The interaction is as follows:

- The main screen lists all repositories a user has access to
- The dropdown box at the top ('Filter by ${x}') shows only repositories from
  that namespace (ie `repository.namespace === x`).
- Pagination at the bottom works for listing all repositories and when filtering
  repositories by namespace

These are the only interactions that need to be defined.

There are **no** expectations for how this is to be built; use your favourite
technologies to create the example

You do not need to build out the APIs.  Instead, feel free to create mock APIs
that return a simple JSON object.  Deciding the APIs to use is at your
discretion.

## What we look for in a solution

We're looking for an overview of your UI building skills.  This includes:

- Basic web knowledge (html/js/css)
- Framework experience + choices
- UI architecture + design approach
- API design, requirements and usage
- Security considerations
- Use of tooling

We'll also walk through your solution to learn each of your approaches and have
you explain your design decisions, explaining the pros and cons of each.
